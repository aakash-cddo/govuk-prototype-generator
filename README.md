# GOV.UK AI Prototype Generator

This prototype can be used to generate pages that look like GOV.UK using a natural language description of what the page needs to do. 

Do not share the code outside of the UK government and do not use the prototypes generated with it in production.

To run the app, you will need to add an OpenAI API key in `.env`.

Let me know what you think of it ✌️
